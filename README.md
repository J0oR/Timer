#### Features
The application consists of a timer with a circular progress bar that emits a sound upon completion.
The time can be adjusted using the + and - buttons on the edges of the slider, as well as by the slider itself.
Additionally, there is a log of all completed sessions.
Finally, this being an academic project, there is a button that switches between seconds and milliseconds, to facilitate testing.
